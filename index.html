		  <h3>Poor javascript writing is plaguing the world!</h3>
			<p><em>Most javascript code sucks...</em>.  While most people focus on writing fast javascript, most of the time it is people programming the incorrect way and not taking advantage of the wonderful language that javascript is.</p>
			<h3>Does this sound familiar?</h3>
			<ul>
			  <li>You open up <strong>ONE javascript file</strong> that controls the entire app</li>
			  <li id='gist'>That one file contains code that is just one big pile of mud like this:
			    
			    <script src="https://gist.github.com/1650777.js?file=Crazytown.js" type="text/javascript" charset="utf-8"></script>

			  </li>
			  <li>All the good practices you use in other languages go out the window while you hack in some quick solution</li>
			  <li>You really don't get javascript or why people even like it... You think javascript is for noobs</li>
			  <li>You're a backend developer not some UI engineer, why on earth would someone need to know JS?</li>
			</ul>
			<h3><strong>Wake up!</strong> Javascript is the language of the Web and we need to make it awesome</h3>
			<h2>You need to buy <span class='title'>Writing Professional Javascript</span></h2>
			<a href='#buy'>Buy now</a>
			<h3>I'm here to help included in the course you'll get:</h3>
			<ul>
			  <li>A collection of how to write Javascript like a professional programmer</li>
			  <li>One bonus guide on how to develop your javascript using test driven development</li>
			  <li>Tons of road tested code samples.  You will be able to feel the difference between the two</li>
			  <li>Screencast on philosophies behind making good javascript and why you should care</li>
			</ul>
			
			<h3>Learn Javascript Craftsmanship</h3>
			<ul>
			  <li>First you learn <strong>object orientation</strong> in javascript.  Most people write javascript like it's C and yet it's far from it.  In fact Javascript is a special type of object oriented language that takes a special care to understand.  In this course we will explain all of that to you</li>
			  <li>Second you learn how to <strong>utilize javascript's anonymous functions</strong>.  You'll learn how to curry functions, when to use closures, and why this is totally awesome.  Javascript unlike other object oriented languages (Java I'm looking at you), lets you do some really neat things.  In this section we'll also talk about memoization which will speed up your functions.</li>
			  <li>Third you'll learn <strong>how to run a javascript project</strong> from start to finish.  Most people think that all javascript belongs in one big file and that they don't need to focus on organizing functionality.  Utilizing what we learn in the object oriented section as well as the anonymous function section we'll learn how to organize a simple app using javascript.</li>
			  <li>As a bonus <strong>You'll learn how to develop using test driven development</strong>.  Utilizing tests will force you to develop in a very different fashion first asking what you want and then going out to build it.  You will introduce far fewer bugs with this style and be able to spend your time doing something cooler.</li>
			</ul>

        <h3>I trust you</h3>
  			<p>With all of this talk about SOPA and PIPA, there is a lot of piracy out there. But I don't see it as a need to put DRM controls on this material.  Instead I'm going to leave it open and hope that you find enough value in it to pay me what I believe it's worth.</p>
